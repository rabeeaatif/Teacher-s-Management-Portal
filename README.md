# Teacher-s-Management-Portal
Advanced data structures project using Python that worked on the principles of graphs and trees. It incorporated a desktop based GUI interface that would be accessible to all students and would give them easy to access to the possible current location of their teachers on campus, their office hours etc. The project was designed in a way to take in diverse queries like "All teachers of the Computer Science Dept. free between 1 and 2" and this would give them the desired output.
